## How to compile

### On Windows (Recommended)

#### 1. Install software

##### Main requirements

##### IDE

###### Visual Studio Community
The recommended way to compile Mission Planner is through Visual Studio.
You could do it with Visual Studio Community [Visual Studio Download page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ "Visual Studio Download page").
Visual Studio suite is quite complex and comes with Git support. During the Selection phase, please goto More > import configuration, and use the file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArduPilot/MissionPlanner/master/.vsconfig ".vsconfig")

###### VSCode
Currently VSCode with C# plugin is able to parse the code but cannot build.

#### 2. Get the code

If you get Visual Studio Community, you should be able to use Git from the IDE. 
Just clone `https://github.com/ArduPilot/MissionPlanner.git` to get the full code.

In case you didn't install an IDE, you will need to manually install Git. Please follow instruction in https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/where-to-get-the-code.html#downloading-the-code-using-git
