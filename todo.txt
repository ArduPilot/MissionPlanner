- implementation of velocity missing
- try to avoid LINQ (...ToList<...>())
- find more efficient way to determine upper and lower limits
- check, if user enabled energyprofile!


- future:
  - (evtl.) user should be able to set certain values (I and V) for approximated polynom
  - spline interpolation would allow a nice approximated polynom
