Complete implementation of linear interpolation for I(alpha) and V(alpha) will follow
=> Energyprofilemenu allows user to configure estimated current at -90,45,0,45,90 ("base current usage per sec.")
   also est. speeds at a specific angle

   combined with the distance, the energyconsumption will be calculated out of those parameters

----

notes:
use of dictionary and key binary search to determine upper and lower bounds of a specific angle
