# Raw ESC command normalized into [-8192, 8191]. The ESC should normalize the setpoint into its effective input range.
# Non-zero setpoint value below minimum should be interpreted as min valid setpoint for the given motor. Positive
# values indicate forward rotation, negative values indicate reverse rotation, and zero indicates no rotation. For example,
# a typical quadcopter always commands non-negative values for all four motors, independent of ESC configuration,
# motor wiring, or propeller direction. ESCs which do not allow reverse rotation shall clamp negative commands to zero.
