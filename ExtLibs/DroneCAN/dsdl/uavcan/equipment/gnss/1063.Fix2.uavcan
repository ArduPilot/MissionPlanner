uavcan.Timestamp gnss_timestamp

#
# Method used for deriving the GNSS timestamp field.
# This data type relies on the following definitions:
#
#   Leap seconds  - Accumulated one-second adjustments applied to UTC since 1972.
#                   For reference, on May 2017, the number of leap seconds was equal 27.
#                   The number of leap seconds is taken from the field num_leap_seconds.
#                   Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second for a general overview.
#
#   TAI timestamp - The number of microseconds between the current TAI time and
#                   the TAI time at UTC 1970-01-01T00:00:00.
#
#   UTC timestamp - The number of microseconds between the current UTC time and
#                   UTC 1970-01-01T00:00:00.
#                   UTC can be expressed via TAI as follows (in seconds):
#                       UTC = TAI - num_leap_seconds - 10
#                   And via GPS (in seconds):
#                       UTC = GPS - num_leap_seconds + 9
#
#   GPS timestamp - The number of microseconds between the current GPS time and
#                   the GPS time at UTC 1970-01-01T00:00:00.
#                   GPS time can be expressed via TAI as follows (in seconds):
#                       GPS = TAI - 19
