# Given min election timeout and cluster size, the maximum recommended request interval can be derived as follows:
#
#   max recommended request interval = (min election timeout) / 2 requests / (cluster size - 1)
#
# The equation assumes that the Leader requests one Follower at a time, so that there's at most one pending call
# at any moment. Such behavior is optimal as it creates uniform bus load, but it is actually implementation-specific.
# Obviously, request interval can be lower than that if needed, but higher values are not recommended as they may
# cause Followers to initiate premature elections in case of intensive frame losses or delays.
#
# Real timeout is randomized in the range (MIN, MAX], according to the Raft paper.

# Worst-case replication time per Follower can be computed as:
#
#   worst replication time = (127 log entries) * (2 trips of next_index) * (request interval per Follower)
