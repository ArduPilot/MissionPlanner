# This is a union, which means that this structure can contain either one of the fields below.
# The structure is prefixed with tag - a selector value that indicates which particular field is encoded.
#

@union                          # Tag is 3 bit long, so outer structure has 5-bit prefix to ensure proper alignment

Empty empty                     # Empty field, used to represent an undefined value.

int64        integer_value
float32      real_value         # 32-bit type is used to simplify implementation on low-end systems
uint8        boolean_value      # 8-bit value is used for alignment reasons
uint8[<=128] string_value       # Length prefix is exactly one byte long, which ensures proper alignment of payload
