# Name of the parameter to enumerate, e.g. ESC index.
# If the name is left empty, the node will infer the parameter name automatically (autodetect).
# It is highly recommended to always use autodetection in order to avoid dependency on hard-coded parameter names,
# and also allow the enumeratee to possibly enumerate multiple different parameters at once.
# The rule of thumb is to always leave this parameter empty unless you really know what you're doing.
