# Write into a remote file.
# The server shall place the contents of the field 'data' into the file pointed by 'path' at the offset specified by
# the field 'offset'.
#
# When writing a file, the client should repeatedly call this service with data while advancing offset until the file
# is written completely. When write is complete, the client shall call the service one last time, with the offset
# set to the size of the file and with the data field empty, which will signal the server that the write operation is
# complete.
#
# When the write operation is complete, the server shall truncate the resulting file past the specified offset.
#
# Server implementation advice:
# It is recommended to implement proper handling of concurrent writes to the same file from different clients, for
# example by means of creating a staging area for uncompleted writes (like FTP servers do).
