# Nested type.
# Coarse, low-resolution 3D orientation represented as fixed axes in 16 bit.
#
# Roll, pitch, yaw angles in radians should be multiplied by
# ANGLE_MULTIPLIER in order to convert them to the coarse representation.
#
# ANGLE_MULTIPLIER = NORM / PI
#
# Where NORM is 12, because it:
#  - Fits the maximum range of a signed 5 bit integer
#  - Allows to exactly represent the following angles:
#    0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, and negatives
