#
# This service carries arbitrary data in the format of the specified high-level protocol.
# The data will be delivered to the specified node only (not broadcast), and the addressed node
# will be required to respond (although the response may be empty, if the chosen protocol allows so).
# The specified protocol applies both to the request and to the response. The channelID allows for
# additional routing between the source and target nodes.
