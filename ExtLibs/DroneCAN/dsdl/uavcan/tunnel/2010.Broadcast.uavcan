# This message struct carries arbitrary data in the format of the specified high-level protocol.
# The data will be delivered to all nodes that are interested in tunneled protocols.
# Finer addressing schemes may be implemented using the means provided by the encapsulated protocol.
# The channelID allows for additional routing between the source and target nodes.
