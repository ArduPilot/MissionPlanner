/*
 * DataListView - A data-bindable listview
 *
 * Author: Phillip Piper
 * Date: 27/09/2008 9:15 AM
 *
 * Change log:
 * 2015-02-02   JPP  - Made Unfreezing more efficient by removing a redundant BuildList() call
 * v2.6
 * 2011-02-27   JPP  - Moved most of the logic to DataSourceAdapter (where it
 *                     can be used by FastDataListView too)
 * v2.3
 * 2009-01-18   JPP  - Boolean columns are now handled as checkboxes
 *                   - Auto-generated columns would fail if the data source was 
 *                     reseated, even to the same data source
 * v2.0.1
 * 2009-01-07   JPP  - Made all public and protected methods virtual 
 * 2008-10-03   JPP  - Separated from ObjectListView.cs
