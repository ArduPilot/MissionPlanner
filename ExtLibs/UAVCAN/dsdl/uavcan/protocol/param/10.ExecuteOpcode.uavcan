# SAVE operation instructs the remote node to save the current configuration parameters into a non-volatile
# storage. The node may require a restart in order for some changes to take effect.
#
# ERASE operation instructs the remote node to clear its configuration storage and reinitialize the parameters
# with their default values. The node may require a restart in order for some changes to take effect.
#
# Other opcodes may be added in the future (for example, an opcode for switching between multiple configurations).
