# THIS DEFINITION IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.
#
# This message is used by allocation servers to find each other's node ID.
# Please refer to the specification for details.
#
# A server should stop publishing this message as soon as it has discovered all other nodes in the cluster.
#
# An exception applies: when a server receives a Discovery message from another server where the list
# of known nodes is incomplete (i.e. len(known_nodes) < configured_cluster_size), the server must
# publish a discovery message once. This condition allows other servers to quickly re-discover the cluster
# after restart.
#

#
# This message should be broadcasted by the server at this interval until all other servers are discovered.
#

# Number of servers in the cluster as configured on the sender.
#
uint8 configured_cluster_size

#
# Node ID of servers that are known to the publishing server, including the publishing server itself.
# Capacity of this array defines maximum size of the server cluster.
