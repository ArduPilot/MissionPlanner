#
# This service initiates firmware update on a remote node.
#
# The node that is being updated (slave) will retrieve the firmware image file 'image_file_remote_path' from the node
# 'source_node_id' using the file read service, then it will update the firmware and reboot.
#
# The slave can explicitly reject this request if it is not possible to update the firmware at the moment
# (e.g. if the node is busy).
#
# If the slave node accepts this request, the initiator will get a response immediately, before the update process
# actually begins.
#
# While the firmware is being updated, the slave should set its mode (uavcan.protocol.NodeStatus.mode) to
# MODE_SOFTWARE_UPDATE.
