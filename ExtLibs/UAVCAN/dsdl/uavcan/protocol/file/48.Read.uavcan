#
# Read file from a remote node.
# 
# There are two possible outcomes of a successful service call:
#  1. Data array size equals its capacity. This means that the end of the file is not reached yet.
#  2. Data array size is less than its capacity, possibly zero. This means that the end of file is reached.
# 
# Thus, if the client needs to fetch the entire file, it should repeatedly call this service while increasing the
# offset, until incomplete data is returned.
#
# If the object pointed by 'path' cannot be read (e.g. it is a directory or it does not exist), appropriate error code
# will be returned, and data array will be empty.
