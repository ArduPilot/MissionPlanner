# The estimated amount of fuel.
# The reported values can be either measured directly using appropriate sensors,
# or they can be estimated by fusing the data provided by various sensors.
# For example, a Kalman filter can be used to fuse the data from fuel level sensors and flow sensors.
# All fields are required.
#
uint7 available_fuel_volume_percent     # Unit: percent, from 0% to 100%
float32 available_fuel_volume_cm3       # Unit: centimeter^3

#
# Estimate of the current fuel consumption rate.
# The flow can be negative if the fuel is being transferred between the tanks or during refueling.
# This field is required.
# Unit: (centimeter^3)/minute

# Fuel temperature.
# This field is optional, set to NaN if not provided.
