# Angular velocity samples in radian/second.
# The samples are represented in the body frame, the axes are ordered as follows:
#   1. angular velocity around X (roll rate)
#   2. angular velocity around Y (pitch rate)
#   3. angular velocity around Z (yaw rate)

#
# Linear acceleration samples in meter/(second^2).
# The samples are represented in the body frame, the axes are ordered as follows:
#   1. linear acceleration along X (forward positive)
#   2. linear acceleration along Y (right positive)
#   3. linear acceleration along Z (down positive)

# Covariance matrix. The diagonal entries are ordered as follows:
#   1. roll rate                (radian^2)/(second^2)
#   2. pitch rate               (radian^2)/(second^2)

#   4. forward acceleration     (meter^2)/(second^4)
#   5. rightward acceleration   (meter^2)/(second^4)
#   6. downward acceleration    (meter^2)/(second^4)
